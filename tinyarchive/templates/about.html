        Hello! We are group 7, consisting of Divya, Pallavi, Sara and Vicky. Divya worked on composing the model, Pallavi worked on the HTML, Sara worked on the CSS, and Vicky worked on the narratives.
    Our archive talks about various global collection of Starbucks mugs. Starbucks is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle. As of November 2021, the company had 33,833 stores in 80 countries, 15,444 of which were located in the United States. the We choose to digitize the mugs because their mugs from different countries reflects how they apply effective marketing strategies in different countries/regions. For example, the Starbucks merchandises in Asian country is more popular than the actual Starbucks coffee. Journalist from sohu points out that Starbucks reinforces brand loyalty through creating special edition drinks and merchandises for each holiday. Hopefully you can learn more about how big corporations uses branding strategy through holiday/limited edition merchandises to consolidate their brand loyalty!
